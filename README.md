# Traveling Salesmen Problem Solving by Dynamic Programming & GVNS (TSP)

In this project we shall discuss on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) a very famous NP-hard problem and will take a few attempts to solve it, using Dynamic programming, or by using approximation algorithms (GVNS) and work on the corresponding python implementations.
